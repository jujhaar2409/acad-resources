# Acad Resources

I put up some resources that might help you with academics on the site which this repo is the source for.

## Technical stuff

I use something called tree-make([https://github.com/jujhaar2409/tree-make](link)) to construct the tree of files that you can see on the website homepage. It is a fun little tool I made, go check it out ([https://github.com/jujhaar2409/tree-make](here) if you are interested!
