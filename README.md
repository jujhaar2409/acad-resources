# Acad Resources

I put up some resources that might help you with academics on the site which this repo is the source for.

## Technical stuff

I use something called tree-make([link to repo](https://github.com/jujhaar2409/tree-make)) to construct the tree of files that you can see on the website homepage. It is a fun little tool I made, go check it out [here](https://github.com/jujhaar2409/tree-make) if you are interested!
